Start
Step 1 - Get the number n 
Step 2 - Initialize RESULT to 1 and i = 1
Step 3 -  Check if n is equal to 0.     
          If n == 0 THEN
          Print "The factorial of 0 is 1"
          Return 1 
          Else continue to the next step.
Step 4 -  For each number i from 1 to n, repeat
          For i = 1 to n:
          Multiply RESULT by i (RESULT = RESULT * i).
Step 5 -  After the loop finishes, print the value of RESULT as the factorial of n.
