Start
Step 1 - Read string s.
Step 2 - Set left = 0 and right = length of s - 1.
Step 3 - while left < right:
         If s[left] is not equal to s[right]:
         Print "Not a palindrome"
         End the function
Step 4 - Increment left by 1 and decrement right by 1 and repeat step 3
Step 5 - Print "Palindrome" if no mismatches were found
End
